// Firstly we need to create two folders:

i. Backend
ii. Frontend
Backend:

1. Go to backend terminal and write 'npm init -y'.
2. Go to 'package.json' file and write 'type: modules'
3. In terminal write 'npm i express nodemon'
4. Go to 'package.json' and in scripts write this:
   "scripts": {
   "start": "node index.js",
   "dev": "nodemon index.js"
   },
5. Create a 'index.js' file in backend folder
6. Now create a file 'config.js'
7. Go to mongodb.com -> create collection (no need to create if already exists) -> Click 'connect' -> drivers -> copy link.
8. Paste link in config.js in a const variable and replace <username> and <password> with actual username and password AND project folder name before question mark..
9. To create a connection install mongoose 'npm i mongoose'
10. import mongoose in index.js and using connect() we can connect mongodb database and index.js or our backend.
11. Create a models folder and in that create 'bookModel.js'
12. In this file we create schema for our book
    MONGODB REPRESENTATION IN NODEJS/EXPRESSJS:

---

## | CODE SIDE => MONGODB |

| DATABASE DATABASE |
| SETUP => FORMATION |

| MODEL => COLLECTION |

| SCHEMA => DOCUMENTS |

---

13. Make sure to export everything and only then you can import

14. request => data sent by client
15. response => data sent by server
16. Also one more thing our main file will be our 'index.js' in backend which we will be running 'npx nodemon index.js'
17. Now to check POST request we need to use postman.com.
    POSTMAN.COM:
    Click new tab -> Select request method (POST in our case) -> To send body to our route click on 'Body'->Change text to JSON
18. CORS policy: Cross-origin resource sharing is a security mechanism in web browsers that restricts the ability of web page to make requests to a different domain.
    It prevents unauthorised cross origin access to a resource or server.

<!-- FRONTEND -->

1. In your main project folder go to terminal
2. Write npm create vite@latest OR npm create-react-app
3. For vite write name of your folder when asked for vite-project name
4. Select React -> JavaScript
5. In terminal install tailwind css
6. Go to tailwind.config.js
